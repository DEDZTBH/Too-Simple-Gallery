This is a very very very simple gallery webpage that displays you pictures. It is pure HTML+JS+CSS. No PHP.

I have only tested it on Chrome. 

## How to use
1. Put index.html and jquery-3.3.1.min.js on your server. Make sure you can access them.
2. Create a folder called img. Put your images in it.
3. That's it. You can now use the index.html.
